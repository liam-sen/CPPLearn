I work at bar in the evenings.
I'm also fluent in sign language.
Tonight a deaf man sat alone in my section , so I chatted with him in sign.
The table next to him noticed and asked me how long I've been signing, etc.
Then I found this on their table.
"Thank you for what you do.
It absolutely matters!
Good luck in finishing your degree!
I will be paying this forward."
